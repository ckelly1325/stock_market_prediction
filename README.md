# Stock Market Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
This is my graduate capstone research project, from the spring 2021 semester. The project is to find tweets that are finance-related, determine the tweets sentiment, group the stocks according to sector (and cryptocurrency), and try to predict whether the group of stocks will increase or decrease one year later based on the tweet's sentiment. My goal is to build a model that can predict the longer-term results of a group of stocks, which is why I chose the one-year timeline. I used different Jupyter notebooks for the different sections of the project. This project is still in-progress.

## Table of Contents
1. parse_twitter_stream.ipynb - contains the code to parse the Twitter data that was downloaded from archive.org, filter to relevant and potentially relevant tweets, and save this new dataset.
2. finance_twitter_exploration_cleaning_sentiment.ipynb - code for the basic data exploration that was done, the cleaning/preprocessing, and performing the sentiment analysis.
